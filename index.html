    <h1>Post Mortem</h1>
    <p>The game engine project has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. While I successfully implemented the core functionality, there is still room for improvement and further development.</p>

    <p>One area that went well was the integration of SDL3, OpenGL, and pybind11. I was able to create a solid foundation for rendering graphics and handling user input, prioritizing the C++ side of the engine. The modular design of the codebase also allowed for easy extension and maintainability.</p>

    <p>However, if given another month on the project, there are several aspects that could be improved. First, I would focus on optimizing the UI, as its currently not so user friendly. Additionally, I would like to add support for more than 1 enemy type being in the game engine.</p>

    <p>Another area of improvement would be the loading system and level creation. While I implemented basic menu systems and level selection, a more intuitive and less restrictive system would be be better for pacing and functionality.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I would consider adding support for more advanced features, such as physics simulations, particle systems, and scripting capabilities. These features would not only enrich the gameplay experience but also open up new possibilities for game development.</p>

    <p>Overall, while the current state of the project is functional and serves as a solid foundation, there is still room for growth and improvement. With additional time and effort, I could turn this game engine into a robust and feature-rich platform for game development.</p>
