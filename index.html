    <h1>Post Mortem</h1>
    <p>The game engine project has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. While we have successfully implemented the core functionality, there is still room for improvement and further development.</p>

    <p>One area that went well was the integration of SDL3, OpenGL, and pybind11. We were able to create a solid foundation for rendering graphics and handling user input. The modular design of the codebase also allowed for easy extension and maintainability.</p>

    <p>However, if given another month on the project, there are several aspects that could be improved. First, we would focus on optimizing the rendering pipeline to achieve better performance, especially for larger and more complex scenes. Additionally, we would explore the possibility of implementing support for more file formats, such as PNG and JPEG, to provide more flexibility in asset management.</p>

    <p>Another area of improvement would be the user interface. While we have implemented basic menu systems and level selection, a more intuitive and visually appealing interface could greatly enhance the overall user experience.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, we would consider adding support for more advanced features, such as physics simulations, particle systems, and scripting capabilities. These features would not only enrich the gameplay experience but also open up new possibilities for game development.</p>

    <p>Overall, while the current state of the project is functional and serves as a solid foundation, there is still room for growth and improvement. With additional time and effort, we could turn this game engine into a robust and feature-rich platform for game development.</p>
